#Recipe Box!

###By Ellen Lehman

##Set Up
To set up this program, clone the repository from Github and open the program in your terminal by running $ruby recipe_box_ui.rb.


##What It Does
This program helps a kitchen keep track of each recipe that a cook creates.  A recipe box can be assigned to a cook and then recipes can be added into each box.  Cooks can have multiple boxes and recipes can be added to many different boxes.

##Known Bugs
At this time, the user interface is not built to edit or delete cooks, boxes, or recipes.  You must create a cook before you can do anything else in the program.  The clear feature cannot delete from the join table, but a user will not be able to access those associations after clear has been run.
